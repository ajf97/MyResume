I was thrilled to see your listing for the research about Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for Summer 2020. As a highly passionate Mathematics and Computer Science student at Macalester College with a solid background in pure math, programming, and data analysis, I am confident that I would be a strong addition to your team.

I love unveiling the elegance of mathematics, especially geometry. In high school, I won the first prize in the Chinese Mathematics League. At that time, I was indulged in a problem involved with trajectory in plane geometry, so I generalized that problem and finally published an article about the geometric transformation and trajectory in \textit{Chinese Periodical Mathematical Study and Research}. Gradually, I was exposed to the algebraic geometry, discrete geometry, and topology, and feeling the power of the geometry. Since I am also intrigued by the application of mathematics, I love learning data science and computer science so that I can solve more complex and practical problems by computer as well, but I never thought about the combination of the topology and data analysis. As I always describe the mathematics as an "elegant" language, I believe I can open up a new world to analyze data by more efficient and ingenious methods after I learn TDA, improving my understanding of the geometry especially the topology and providing me experience for further study in graduate school in the future. 

I am a self-motivated and fast learner. Though I am a first-year student, I love challenging and learning extra knowledge that I am interested in by myself. In the winter break, I learned machine learning and I won $13^{th}$ place out of 19526 teams and individuals(0.06\%) in Kaggle Data Science competition building models in Python. As I looked through the winners algorithms, to my surprise, the algorithm involved with TDA is much faster and more accurate than traditional methods while analyzing high dimensions and clustered data. Therefore, I wish eagerly that I can have this opportunity working with your research to learn how to employ topology in data analysis and visualization.

 For your convenience, I have attached a resume that further outlines my relevant skill set, experience, and accomplishments. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!
